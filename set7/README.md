Some of these tests will take a while. Test 53 will take about 7 seconds to run,
and test 51 will take about 40 seconds to run. Furthermore, test 51 has about an
87% success rate (doesn't always make the right guesses when extending the known
plaintext), so more than one run might be necessary.

The `release` build has been enabled by default in this folder, so no
`--release` flag is necessary.
